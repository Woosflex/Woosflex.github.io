# **About Me**  

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Think of me as your friendly neighborhood **bioinformatics adventurer**—armed with a keyboard, a pipette, and a steady supply of memes.

**From tinkering with tech to exploring the secrets of life:**  
I built my first Frankenstein PC at 13 (she was a beauty, though her fans screamed like banshees), but biology whispered its siren song. Microbes? Fascinating. Code? A puzzle I couldn’t resist. So, I found my happy place in **bioinformatics**, where I bridge these worlds, cracking life's mysteries one sequence at a time.  

But let’s be real—life isn’t all algorithms and lab coats. When I’m not wrangling data or debugging like it’s a *Dark Souls* boss fight, I’m diving into the profound narratives of seinen manga or sharpening my *(not-so-deadly)* chess skills.

### **What’s Cooking?**  
Right now, I’m exploring:  
- Improving my R package, **Gc Visualyst**, with machine learning wizardry.  
- Drafting plans to clone it into Python (hello, versatility!).  
- Tackling my MSc Bioinformatics journey at JMI.  

Along the way, I'll share my **coding adventures, project updates, and guides** to help others navigate the bioinformatics maze!

- [**Gc Visualyst**](https://www.github.com/woosflex/gcvisualyst): My R package for GC peak visualization and analysis, including CpG island detection.  
- [**AutophiGen**](https://www.github.com/woosflex/autophigen) *(Deprecated for now but plotting a revival!)*: Python CLI that made phylogenetics easy, soon to be reborn along with the power of ML, *“the lone savior of phylogenetic analysis it will be”* as stated by Master Yoda himself.

Life’s a mix of science, code, and a sprinkle of fun. If you’re into bioinformatics, coding, or just swapping chess memes, let’s connect and explore this adventure together!
