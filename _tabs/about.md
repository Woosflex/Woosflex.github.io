From tinkering with tech to unraveling life's code: Building my first Frankenstein PC at 13 sparked my love for computers, but biology whispered its secrets, drawing me into the captivating world of microbes. Bioinformatics became my Rosetta Stone, bridging my passions and letting me use code to crack the mysteries of life, one sequence at a time. It's an exhilarating puzzle with living pieces, and I'm hooked! 

Beyond the lab: When not knee-deep in data or wrestling scientific papers (chess battles are more my speed, though my 350 ELO might disagree!), I delve into the intricate narratives and nuanced characters of seinen manga. So, here I am, a curious explorer on a bioinformatics mission. Join me as we unravel life's mysteries, one code sequence at a time!

## Skills: Bridging the Gap Between Code and Lab Coat 
Forget choosing between lab coat and keyboard - I'm fluent in both! Here's what I bring to the table:
### 1. Technical Tools
- Python

- C 

- R

- LaTeX

- Bash

### 2. Laboratory Skills
- Leadership

- Quick-Learner

- Problem Solver

I'm constantly learning, evolving, and adding new tools to my toolbox. So, if you're looking for someone with a blend of technical expertise, lab experience, and a dash of humor (because let's face it, science can get pretty serious), don't hesitate to reach out! 

## My Projects
### AutophiGen: Automating Phylogenetic Analysis with One Command (Now with a Powerful WebApp!)

Remember those endless command lines and software juggling during your final projects? Me too. That's why I built AutophiGen, a Python tool that takes the "phylo" out of "phylogeny" by automating the entire analysis pipeline. And now, there's even more to get excited about: **a brand new web application is in production**, taking AutophiGen to the next level!

- **Forget wrestling with software** - It's time to streamline your workflow: The AutophiGen webapp takes your sequences and guides you through analysis with a single click. No more complex commands, just powerful features at your fingertips.

- **Dive deeper with advanced options**: While the CLI offers a quick and easy experience, the webapp empowers you to customize your analysis. **Select various BLAST methods, databases, and score matrices** to tailor your results to your specific needs.

- **Explore different tree building methods**: Beyond basic phylogenetic trees, the webapp allows you to utilize UPGMA and Neighbor Joining algorithms, providing diverse perspectives on your data.

- **Visualize your results in style**: See your stunning phylogenetic trees come to life with interactive graphics within the webapp. Easily export them for presentations, publications, or further analysis.

- **Multiple sequences are no problem**: Throw multiple sequences in one FASTA file, and AutophiGen handles them like a champ. No more splitting and merging headaches.

But wait, there's more! The AutophiGen webapp is still under development, and exciting new features are on the horizon. Stay tuned for performance improvements, additional tree building algorithms, and an even more user-friendly interface.

>#### Join the **Auto-Phylo-lution**, today!

The AutophiGen webapp is currently in production, and while not yet publicly available, I'm eager to get your feedback! You can check out the CLI version on [Github](https://www.github.com/woosflex/autiphigen) now and join the waiting list for the webapp launch. Together, let's make bioinformatics less "phylo" and more "fun"!

## Education 
### 2020 - 2023: Sharda University, India - B.Sc. Microbiology
- **CGPA**: 8.75/10

- **Favourite Coursework**: Bioinformatics (where biology meets code, my kind of party!), Molecular Biology (dissecting life's secrets, one molecule at a time), Cell Biology (the building blocks of everything, fascinating!)

- **Dissertation**: "Comparison of Anti-HCV titre and p53 proteins among HCV patients" (yep, I battled hepatitis C with proteins and fancy techniques... you're welcome, world!)

- **Dissertation Guide**:  Prof. Vinod Joshi, a legend in the life sciences game (and my patient advisor through the dissertation maze)

### Pre-University Adventures:
- **2018**: R.S.B.V. Gandhi Nagar - HSC (12th): Passed with 67.4% (discovered life beyond textbooks... like video games and ramen!)

- **2016**: St. Andrews Scots Sr. Sec. School - SSC (10th): 9.4/10 CGPA (okay, maybe I was a bit of a nerd back then...)

## Experience

For me, experience isn't just about formal jobs and internships. It's about rolling up your sleeves, diving into diverse challenges, and making a difference along the way. Here's a glimpse into my journey:
### Lab Leader and Scientific Communicator:
- **Organizing scientific models for NAAC visit**: From dissecting microbes to crafting captivating models, I led my team to showcase the lab's research prowess. (Think science meets art meets nervous laughter as deadlines approach!)

- **Summer project on COVID-19**: Lockdown? More like lock-down on understanding its impact! I analyzed data, built models, and presented my findings, contributing to the ongoing socio-economic fight against the pandemic.
### Computational Adventures and Knowledge Crusade:
- **CS50x & CS50p**: Conquered the coding challenges of Harvard's legendary CS courses, mastering Python from loops to algorithms. Now I dream in code (don't worry, I still speak fluent human too!).

- **Website Architect**: Revamped my university lab's website, bringing a touch of digital finesse to the world of microbes. Now researchers can navigate their research with ease (and a touch of style).

- **Courses galore**: From infection and immunity to data analysis and drawing, I'm on a quest for knowledge, devouring online courses like a hungry microbe devouring nutrients. (Okay, maybe that's a stretch, but you get the point!)

- **NGS & Shotgun Sequencing Workshop**: Gearing up for an NGS and shotgun sequencing workshop in January, ready to unlock the secrets of next-generation sequencing and unravel genomes like a pro.

### Beyond the Lab and Classroom: 
- **E-waste warrior**: Trained in safe and effective e-waste management making sure even my discarded tech contributes to a greener future. (Because saving the planet is cool, even if landfills aren't.)

- **Spelling champion and science olympiad hero**: Okay, these were from middle school, but hey, they taught me the power of learning and perseverance. (Plus, who doesn't love bragging about spelling "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" correctly?)
